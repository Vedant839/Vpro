This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their petal and sepal measurements. Using Python's scikit-learn library, we implement a Random Forest classifier to train and predict flower species with high accuracy. The project covers essential steps in the ML pipeline, including data loading, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. This is an ideal starting point for beginners to learn the fundamentals of supervised learning and to understand the practical application of machine learning algorithms.# Vpro
